                    <img src="Tic_tac_toe.png" alt="Project Image 1" class="project-image">
                    <p class="project-description">I developed an interactive Tic Tac Toe game website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project involved designing a user-friendly interface that allows two players to engage in the classic game directly from their browsers. I implemented core game logic in JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and intuitive gameplay experience. Through this project, I honed my skills in front-end development and learned to effectively manage user interactions.</p>

                    <img src="netflix.png" alt="Project Image 1" class="project-image">
                    <p class="project-description">As part of a hands-on learning experience, I developed a replica of the Netflix landing page by following a tutorial series from "Code with Harry" on YouTube. This project was crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on achieving a high-fidelity visual and functional mimicry of Netflix's original landing page. The process involved creating a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, implementing interactive elements such as login forms and a carousel for featured content. This endeavor not only enhanced my skills in front-end development but also deepened my understanding of user interface design and how to recreate popular web designs effectively.</p>

                    <img src="touchsenso.png" alt="Project Image 1" class="project-image">
                    <p class="project-description">In a hands-on electronics project, I constructed a touch sensor circuit using a transistor to activate a light bulb upon human contact. This initiative involved careful planning and assembly of the circuit components, including soldering connections for stability and performance. I meticulously implemented the transistor as a switch in the circuit, which enabled the bulb to illuminate through touch activation. This project not only sharpened my soldering skills but also deepened my understanding of basic electronic components and their interactions in creating functional devices. Through this experience, I gained practical insights into the fundamentals of circuit design and the dynamic behavior of transistors.</p>

                    <img src="project1.png" alt="Project Image 1" class="project-image">
                    <p class="project-description">For a recent web development project, I designed and implemented a sophisticated canteen website that generates a unique QR code for every transaction, ensuring each bill is distinctly identifiable and cannot be reused. This feature was achieved by integrating a QR code generator within the site's billing system, which assigns a unique ID to each bill. This system enhances security and streamlines the payment verification process for both customers and canteen staff. In building this website, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface, while backend logic was developed to support QR code generation and verification. This project not only improved my full-stack development skills but also provided practical experience in implementing modern e-commerce security measures.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">Designed and developed my personal portfolio website as a platform to showcase my technical skills and completed projects. The site is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing a clean, modern design that provides an intuitive user experience. Features include a responsive layout, interactive galleries, and detailed case studies of my projects. This website serves as a professional hub for potential employers and collaborators to view my work, understand my capabilities, and contact me. Building this site from scratch not only enhanced my web development skills but also allowed me to express my personal brand and career aspirations effectively.</p>
